# ggsegExtra <img src="man/img/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />  

This package contains extra atlases for the use in the [ggseg]() plotting package in R.

## Atlases
There are currently `r nrow(atlases)` available atlases across `r length(unique(atlases$Package))` packages. 
The packages, their repository name and location can be found with:

```{r}
library(ggsegExtra)

# List all verified compatible atlases
ggseg_atlas_repos()
```


We have tutorials on how to make atlases available in the `Articles` of the [package documentation page](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/ggsegExtra/). 
Currently, the pipeline for making 3d atlases is complete given Freesufer is installed on your system and you have a ready `.annot` file to use for the converions.
Creating 2d atlases is currently still a work in progress, and we are not able to provide a better solution than the one described at the moment. 
We hope to remedy this in the near future.

## Code of Conduct

### Report bugs or requests  
Don't hesitate to ask for support using [github issues](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra/issues), or requesting new atlases. 
While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to it.
