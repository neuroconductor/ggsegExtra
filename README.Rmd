This package contains extra atlases for the use in the [ggseg]() plotting package in R.

## Atlases
There are currently three atlases available in the package:  

### 2d polygon atlases
1. `midsagittal` - mid-sagittal slice showing the cerebellum, 3^rd^ and 4^th^ ventricles, corpus callosum etc.  
2. `glasser` - HCP cortical segmentation (Glasser et al. 2015)  
3. `jhu`- Hua et al. 2008, JHU white-matter tractography atlas    
4. `yeo7`- Yeo et al. 7 resting state networks  
5. `yeo17`- Yeo et al. 17 resting state networks  
6. `tracula` - Yendiki et al. probabilistic white matter tractopraphy  

### 3d mesh atlases
1. `glasser_3d` - HCP cortical segmentation (Glasser et al. 2015)  
2. `desterieux_3d` - Desterieux et al. cortical segmentation  
3. `yeo7_3d` - Yeo et al. 7 resting state networks  
4. `yeo17_3d`- Yeo et al. 17 resting state networks  
6. `schaefer7`- Schaefer et al. 7 resting state networks  
7. `schaefer17`- Schaefer et al. 17 resting state networks  
8. `tracula_3d` - Yendiki et al. probabilistic white matter tractopraphy  
9. `jhu_3d`- Hua et al. 2008, JHU white-matter tractography atlas    
10. `icbm_3d`- JHU labels from Mori et al. (2005) 


We are working on creating a detailed description in the wiki on how to create and contribute atlases to the package.
The `ggseg` function already allows you to provide it with a data.frame of a custom atlas if you have it, but it must correspond to certain specifications to work.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg/wiki/Creating-and-contributing-atlases) for information on adding atlases, or inspect the included datasets for requirements. 
If anything is unclear in the wiki, give us a shout out in the issues!


## Use
You will need to use the `ggseg` package to use these atlases, or wrangle them your self.
You can access it [here](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/ggseg/ggseg.html), or via R:

```{r eval=F}
devtools::install_github("LCBC-UiO/ggseg")
```

Make sure to always load the ggsegExtra package _after_ the ggseg package.

```{r eval=F}
library(ggseg)
library(ggsegExtra)
```


### Report bugs or requests  
Don't hesitate to ask for support using [github issues](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra/issues), or requesting new atlases. 
While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to it.
